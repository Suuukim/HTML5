            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
            It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
            making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,
            a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, 
            looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, 
            from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of 
            the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
